      question: "What is Codesphere?",
      answer:
        "Codesphere makes it easier to create, test, improve and operate cloud software at scale.<br><br>With Codesphere it is easy to maintain an effective development environment, spin up fast preview deployments for each pull request and run entire production landscapes with minimal configuration.<br><br>We combine an online code editor with integrated pipelines that deploy your code to various stages in seconds. This can save you months of DevOps work and will be a lot easier to maintain.<br>Your developers are going to love the reduced context switching during reviews, you will have less bugs because the code is tested in production-like environments and the effort of managing your infrastructure will be greatly reduced. Your developers will be able to handle all this themselves, reducing your dependency on expensive DevOps specialists.",
